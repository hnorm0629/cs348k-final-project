# CS348K Final Project
_DyDef: A Visualization Tool for Dynamic Deformations on Shell Objects_

I am going to develop a GUI that allows users to apply, simulate, and visualize dynamic deformations on shell objects. The project will build on existing computational models for shell deformation and will include features for both simulation control and visualization. I will use DeformFX—a software library for nonlinear finite element simulation—as the foundation of this application. This GUI will primarily serve as a tool for understanding the physical behavior of shell structures under various constraints, but it will also provide a foundation for future extensions such as training AI agents in immersive worlds.
