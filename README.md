# CS348K Final Project
GUI for Dynamic Deformations of Shell Objects

I will develop a GUI that allows users to apply, simulate, and visualize dynamic deformations on shell objects. The project will build on existing computational models for shell deformation and will include features for both simulation control and visualization. This GUI will primarily serve as an educational tool for understanding the physical behavior of shell structures under various conditions and constraints, but it will also provide a foundation for future extensions such as training AI agents in immersive worlds.
